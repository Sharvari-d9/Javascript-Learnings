Global Execution context(GEC)

Function specific Execution Context

When code execution starts first the global execution context is set which has memory and code component.

- Initially all the variables have undefined as their value and fucntions would be stored as is in memory in component.
- for every function a function specific new execution context is created.
- once the fucntion execution is completed the execution context is removed
- once the complete javascript code runs,the global execution context is also removed

Call Stack:
- JS uses call stack to manage creation, deletion of new execution context such as for functions,
  and transfer of control between these contexts

- First entry in the Stack is the GEC
- Contains the order of the executions of all the execution contexts.
