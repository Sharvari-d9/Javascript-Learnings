 * Asynchronous Javascript & Event Loop
 * 
 * Anything put inside a call stack will be executed in that instant. JS will wait for none.
 * 
 * Timers allow to execute some functions after sometime. which wont be possible by the call stack as it executes whatever is pushed to it.
 * 
 * Browser has JS engine inside it.
 * It then has call stack inside it. browser can have a local storage and a timer etc.
 * 
 * To communicate between all this we have web APIs.
 * 
 * Browser has all the superpowers.js engines gets access to all these super powers in the call stack by global variable window.
 * and the superpowers are available through APIs.
